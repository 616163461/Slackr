DEVELOPMENT BRIEF
	
In preparation for iteration 2, we have planned to break down our approach into 4 different parts. These include:

How we will be approaching this iteration
Estimating the time that each function will take
Figuring out what order the functions will be implemented in
Breaking up the functions into logical buckets

In terms of how we will approach iteration 2, we have decided to thoroughly read and understand the specification itself to determine what exactly we are required to implement. If we are unable to comprehend what a specific implementation requires us to do, then we will ask our tutors for further clarification. This ensures that we do not have any misinterpretations about the specification and what is specifically required for each function. If any further help is required by any of our group members, we will flag it on our Trello board to ask for assistance.

Following on from generating the test cases in iteration 1, we have decided to allocate the appropriate functions to each member with respect to the test cases that they have implemented. This allows for the ease of implementation of functions as each member has already understood what that function requires and how it should be implemented. We have also tested the functions that were linked in the same category, in other words, we have tested functions that we believe belong under the same functionality. An example would be implementing auth_register, auth_login, auth_logout together as they belong in the same category. 


This flowchart demonstrates how we will be implementing the functions and the priority of the functions. This will form our method of using logical buckets to tackle iteration 2. The priority order is based upon the starting function to the ending function, with the inclusion of side priority functions as they branch off the side.

The following table is a more detailed representation of the priorities in the workflow. The time column is an estimation of the number of hours we are planning to spend for each function.

As a result, our method of implementing the functions consists of implementing them in a way that we are able to deliver a minimum viable product. Our approach ensures that we have a working product that we can deliver with the proper functionalities and valid authentication.
