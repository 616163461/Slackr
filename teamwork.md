Teamwork (Thom_Browne)

Required:
 - How often you met, and why you met that often
 - What methods you used to ensure that meetings were successful
 - What steps you took when things did not go to plan during iteration 2
 - Details on how you had multiple people working on the same code 

Meeting Times:
Our team holds three main meetings a week:

WEEK PLAN (FOR EVERY WEEK LEADING UP TO DUE DATE)

Meeting #1:
 - Sunday, 8:00 PM - 9:00 PM  Online Conference Call

Meeting #2:
 - Wednesday, 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM,  UNSW Main Library, Meeting Room

Meeting #3:
 - Friday, 6:00 PM - 9:00 PM,  UNSW Main Library, Meeting Room

These meetings were extremely effective for keeping the team focused on the right tasks, and ensured that we remained productive on a daily basis. Furthermore, it built a high transparency on the group’s progress as it enabled the team to communicate and build upon any ongoing issues and ideas. In the physical meetings, we would plan out the workflows for the following days as this needed to be constantly updated (whether it was due to certain errors, workarounds or new specifications). The delegation of responsibilities played a huge part in our implementation’s success, as each team member had the freedom to choose the functions that they felt most comfortable with, and propose ideas and directions for the functions that were more difficult in nature. The online conference call was implemented in an attempt to improve our communication from Iteration 1, as a four day gap between meetings had led to a lack of communication that was seen in the past. Our team had also decided to set up an Excel spreadsheet, where each member had to log the details of their work into the spreadsheet daily. This acted as a daily asynchronous stand-up, as all the information that was scribed could be seen by everyone in the group if we ever needed to refer to past details. These details consisted of what we had achieved that day, any issues that had transpired and what responsibilities/tasks they would take the following day. 

Meeting Guarantee:
The purpose of the daily spreadsheet log was to: note completed items on a daily basis,  identify impediments, and to ensure that everyone plans their next tasks for the following day. 
In the spreadsheet, each team member makes the following three general statements and writes them in the following generalised format:

 - Yesterday, I completed [ some tasks ]
 - Today, I’m going to take on [ various incomplete tasks ]
 - My impediments are [ these specific tasks, if any ]

By focusing on what each person had accomplished yesterday and what was to be accomplished, the team gained an understanding of what work had been done and what work remained to be completed. Not only does this drive communication, but it also motivates team members when they see a certain member doing more than required, incentivising them to work harder. The Excel spreadsheet also gave us direction after completing various tasks, and thus allowed us to plan accordingly using what we were required to complete. It was also extremely useful in identifying areas of struggle within the team, so other team members could help when it was needed.
The purpose of the face-to-face meetings were to make a stage goal and backlog any items that could be fully implemented for the next meeting. The meetings were held at the UNSW Main Library and during this time, each member of the team participated to share their opinions. Each meeting consisted of:

 - Determining the work capacity that was to be completed until the next meeting
 - Assigning tasks amongst the team members based on their experience levels and expertise
 - Fixing any problems and compilation errors that were met along the way
 - Ensuring that the functions were implemented according to the specification requirements and were logical in nature
 - Estimating, prioritising and tasking functions
 
Because of the way we had implemented our Iteration 1, our test files were highly co-dependent on other functions. This meant that an individual's function was accountable for their peers’, and as such it made sure our team members were not straying away from the commitments that were made during the meeting.

Exception Handling:

Our team’s project management accepted uncertainty as a given, and valued responding to change over having a plan. There is no escaping that we have exceptions during the iteration, where our team would place it into the team backlog, the backlog will be shown during the meeting, then our team will further adapt our task plan since we meet the exceptions, all team members will work on it until the next iteration meeting. Furthermore, our team had not effectively managed our time initially as we had the impression that we had lacked the information to implement some functions. Hence, this has led to a reduction in the total amount of time we had to spend on implementing these functions. However soon after realising that we were able to make these functions equipped with the knowledge we had, we immediately began to plan and tackle the functions efficiently. Our workload had been spread across all team members to ensure that we completed the remaining functions with maximum efficiency as well as specialising to effectively craft the functions. This had been achieved by allocating a category of functionality to each member (please refer to the Iteration 2 workflow that was presented during Iteration 1), such that each member took on functions that they had written tests for/ had epic stories for. This had effectively resulted in the efficient spread of workloads to each member.

Code Handling:

Our group has a clear division of working on the code, each member would work on different functions, and once the code is finished, it will be uploaded to the team member’s own branch. However, because some code will need to be worked on by multiple members, we chose to use GitLab, where we would create a new branch, and push/pull code to the new branch. As we began to finalise all the functions, we all cross-checked each others code to ensure that each function had been implemented correctly as well as working with other functions. Another situation where multiple members would work on the same code would be when we were tackling the difficult functions such as “/standup/start” and “/standup/send”. These functions required much more discussion and implementation relative to the other functions, therefore it had required the effort of all members to work on these functions. As we were performing tests, we would therefore be using different functions within some functions as these functions required the functionality of other working functions.
