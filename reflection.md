Iteration 1 - Reflection

OVERVIEW

During Iteration One, our team (Thom_Browne) had prepared for a two week long sprint and expected quite a few setbacks. In preparation, we allocated an extra day for each task in the event of these setbacks. While our team was extremely enthusiastic, there were a lot of mistakes that will be fixed for the new iteration ahead.

WHAT WE DID WELL AT

Instead of using the GitLab board that was provided, we opted to primarily use Trello as our main source of workflow. We thought that Trello would give us much more creative freedom to cater our design and meet our team requirements. In some ways it allowed us to give other members more reminders, constructive criticism and tangible deadlines. Having a backlog on Trello had also been extremely useful, as we have been able to see the progress of all our team members which allowed us to view other members’ progress to see if they needed any help when required.

Our physical weekly meet-ups were also extremely useful; by speaking with team members in person we were able to bounce ideas off each other and were able to reach conclusions much faster with proper direction, i.e, ways to approach a certain test function and how to implement them.
By adopting the “Stand-up” methods, our labs always ended with proper delegation of tasks, as we understood what was expected of each member and the appropriate deadline of the given tasks.

WHAT WE STRUGGLED WITH

A large amount of issues were to do with the actual task at hand. Understanding the tasks within Iteration one took quite a bit of time.This involved understanding the specifications and how to approach writing the test functions.  It was also extremely hard to appropriately delegate tasks to our group members, since our members didn't understand our strengths which ultimately stems from the lack of experience in group projects, testing & development processes. Theoretically, a Trello board would be extremely helpful, but if members forget to follow the board, then its use loses its effect, and as a result, the Trello board often felt like a historical log rather than a directional aid.

While enthusiasm within the team is good, too much of it had led to unpreparedness and a lack of understanding of some tasks. Since we were extremely eager, a lot of the planning and preparation was often revisited and revamped during later stages. Weekly university visits could have also been shortened to daily visits, as consistency in reminders is often more useful than one long session within an extended period of time (think about brushing your teeth for 1 hour every month vs 2 minutes every night). A lot of the work flows were also still being tested, as we couldn’t decide what the best way to approach the task was.

IN HINDSIGHT WHAT WE SHOULD'VE DONE

In hindsight, we should have studied the system requirements in detail before jumping into the task. While enthusiasm is good, understanding system requirements is equally as important. The consensus of the workflow should have also been reached before implementation, as the naming of functions, what times we would merge, and the splitting of branches were extremely unplanned. Lastly, much more frequent calls, meet-ups and stand-ups should have been instilled to regroup our ideas and see where each member is at with their workload.

FORWARD THINKING/ WHAT WE ARE ADOPTING

Moving forward, we will implement the changes that we have critically analysed. This should see a much smoother completion of Iteration Two, with lesser confusion among team members. We also have started to see where each group member shines, and will adjust accordingly to the tasks ahead.
